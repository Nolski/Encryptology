## asymmetric cryptography

A class of cryptography which requires two keys. One public (available to the world) and one private (only you have access to).

## PGP

(Pretty Good Privacy) A key based encryption program used for encryption and decrypting data.

## GPG

A Free and Open Source implementation of PGP. One of the most common used variants of PGP.

## RSA Encryption

An encryption algorithm based on the factorization of large integers. This is widely used and is known to be one of the more difficult algorithms to break.

## DSA Encryption

Encryption algorithm based on the discrete logarithm problem. While faster at generating keys, this is often times deemed not as secure as RSA since they must be only 1028 bits long.
