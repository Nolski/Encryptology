# Encryptology

This book is my first text book of any sort. Encryptology is meant to be a
an easy to pick up guide on getting started with the world of encryption and
a quick start guide for many popular encryption applications across multiple
platforms.

## Contributing

I would be happy to review any changes or additions you suggest. I understand
that I am not the most experienced person with encryption software and will
happily accept and pull requests or advice about explaining certain concepts. So
feel free to open a pull request or create an issue.
