This is widely used and is known to be one of the more difficult algorithms to break."},{"name":"DSA Encryption","id":"dsa encryption","description":"Encryption algorithm based on the discrete logarithm problem. While faster at generating keys, this is often times deemed not as secure as RSA since they must be only 1028 bits long."}]
