# What now?

So now you have created your key pair. Great! GPG has exited and you have both a publickey and privatekey stored somewhere on your computer. Great! Now you can begin decryping and encrypting messages.

###The Key Chain

So before you can encrypt a message to someone you need their *publickey*. When you encrypt a message using their publickey, they can use their privatekey to decrypt it. Same when they try to contact you. They encrypt it with your publickey and you decrypt it with your privatekey.

That's why you can put your publickey online for anyone to use but you must keep your privatekey safe.
